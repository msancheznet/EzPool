			:ivar WorkerQueue _idle: Queue with idle workers
			:ivar dict _running: Dictionary that maps URIs with busy workers
			:ivar dict _result: Dictionary that maps tasks to its results

			To run this distributed pool simply run this file as a script

			To work with the pool from another process, use the following template:

			.. code-block:: Python

					pool = Pyro4.Proxy('PYRO:pool@localhost:21000')	
					pool.register_worker('PYRO:worker@localhost:20000')
					pool.register_worker('PYRO:worker@localhost:20001')

					results = pool.map(inputs)

			Workers of this pool can be any exposed Pyro4 class that contain a `run` method. This
			is called internally be the pool. The following code snippet demonstrates how to build
			a worker:

			.. code-block:: Python

					import Pyro4

					@Pyro4.expose
					class Worker(object):
							def run(self,n):
									result = fib(n)
									print(result)
									return result

					if __name__ == '__main__':
							Pyro4.Daemon.serveSimple({Worker:'worker'}, host='localhost', port=20000, ns=False)

			.. Warning:: For the previous example to work, a pool and two workers must be opened 
									 in separate processes (e.g. separate command windows)
			.. Warning:: The `map` function is implemented using threads. The number of threads 
									 concurrently running is equal to `min(# tasks, # workers)`, so this
									 sets a limitation in the number of tasks that the pool can support
